        <p>Today I received a new task from my teamlead. I actually got no clue what he wanted me to do. 
            The sketch of the website was ... <br> too messy and ... <br>little understandable... </p>
        <p> I wonder if anybody could understand this: </p>

                        <li> 
                        Don‚Äôt use color. If you do, use it intentionally. Color is powerful! As such, it can be distracting.
                        If you must use color, use it sparingly and consistently and choose a color not in the clients‚Äô 
                        pallette to ensure your discussion remains focused on the experience you are creating and not
                        the visual design solutions to come." Your wireframes are meant to facilitate, not distract.
                        </li>  
                        <li>
                        One of the best ways to do this is to be consistent with things like typography, spacing, and delivery.
                        Wireframing and prototyping are amazing tools, but they serve very different purposes. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Prototyping is more time intensive than wireframing. Key functionalities or interactions can be easily communicated 
                        statically.Ask the client what they need. If user testing is an important part of the project, 
                        prototyping may get you far. The key is to know when you‚Äôve crossed over to prototyping and
                        be deliberate about it.
